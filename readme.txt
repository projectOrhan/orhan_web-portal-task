First of all, all the required functionalities are working smoothly.

In addition, I would like to share the user experience improvements I have implemented:

Improvements:

A sorting function has been added to the table columns, allowing users to sort the listed data in ascending or descending order by clicking on the column headers.

A search feature has been added to filter through the listed data. Users can enter any desired expression (e.g., "3a..."), and the interface will narrow down the list to show only entries containing "3a" in any column.

The Reset View button allows users to revert to the full, unsorted list, restoring the table to its initial state.

These improvements aim to help users access the desired information more conveniently.

Best regards,
Orhan
